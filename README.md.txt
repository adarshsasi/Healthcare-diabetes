# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Diabetes Prediction Project. The project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts the presence or absence of diabetes in patients based on various medical predictor variables. The project consists of several tasks, including data exploration, modeling, and reporting.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains the following variables:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: Two-hour serum insulin
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable, 0 or 1 (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)

## Project Tasks

### Week 1 - Data Exploration

- Perform descriptive analysis to understand the variables and identify missing values.
- Visualize the variables using histograms and handle missing values appropriately.

### Week 2 - Data Exploration

- Check the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes.
- Create scatter charts to explore relationships between variables.
- Perform correlation analysis and visualize it using a heat map.

### Week 3 - Data Modeling

- Devise strategies for model building, including the choice of validation framework.
- Apply an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model and compare results with KNN algorithm.

### Week 4 - Data Modeling and Reporting

- Create a classification report with sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values.
- Build a Tableau dashboard with charts and metrics relevant to the project.
